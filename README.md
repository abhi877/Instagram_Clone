My Role:
--------
This project is a major project and Me and My partner(Rashim Narayan Tiku) have used two languages (Java and Python) for back-end programming. My role was to make the coding in Python and Java programming was implemented by my partner. We both divided the work of designing the front-end by using HTML. 

Difficulties:
-------------
The difficulties that we faced in this project were in 'Notification System' and 'Message System'. We wre not able to implement these features properly. We were not getting the fresh notifications and messages. So we implemeted some machine learnign algorithms by using Python language such IMPS.
